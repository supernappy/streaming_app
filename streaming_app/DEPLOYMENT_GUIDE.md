# OpenStream Deployment Guide

## Current Status: ‚ùå NOT READY for full Vercel deployment

### Why Your App Can't Be Fully Deployed to Vercel:

1. **Complex Backend Requirements**:
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Redis caching
   - MinIO storage
   - FFmpeg audio processing
   - WebSocket connections
   - File uploads

2. **Monorepo Structure**:
   - Root package.json manages workspaces
   - Client and server are separate apps
   - Vercel expects single deployable unit

### ‚úÖ What You CAN Deploy to Vercel:

**Only the React client** as a static website

### üöÄ Recommended Deployment Strategy:

#### Step 1: Deploy Frontend to Vercel
```bash
# From your project root
cd client
npm run build
# Deploy the build folder to Vercel
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Backend Separately
**Recommended platforms:**
- Railway (easiest for Node.js + PostgreSQL)
- Render (good free tier)
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Heroku (if you have a paid plan)

#### Step 3: Set Up External Services
- **Database**: PlanetScale, Supabase, or Railway PostgreSQL
- **Redis**: Upstash or Railway Redis
- **Storage**: AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or Supabase Storage

### üìù Required Changes for Vercel Client Deployment:

1. **Update API URLs** in client to point to hosted backend
2. **Configure CORS** in backend for Vercel domain
3. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
4. **Build optimization** for production

### üõ†Ô∏è Alternative: Full Docker Deployment

If you want to keep everything together:
```bash
# Use your existing docker-compose.yml
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Deploy to:
- DigitalOcean Droplet ($5/month)
- AWS EC2
- Google Cloud Compute
- Hetzner VPS

### üí° Next Steps:

1. **Decide on deployment strategy** (hybrid vs full infrastructure)
2. **Set up backend hosting** first
3. **Update client configuration** to use hosted backend
4. **Deploy client to Vercel** as static site

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

- Your app is a **complex streaming platform**, not a simple website
- Full functionality requires proper infrastructure
- Consider costs of hosting all required services
- Audio streaming needs significant bandwidth and storage
