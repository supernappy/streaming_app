### 🔄 Next Steps

**For Development:**
1. Upload some audio files to test streaming
2. Create playlists and rooms
3. Test mobile app functionality
4. Customize the UI/UX as needed

**For Production:**
1. Set up MinIO or S3 for file storage
2. Configure Redis for caching
3. Set up SSL certificates
4. Use production deployment script: `./scripts/deploy-production.sh`

**Additional Features to Implement:**
1. WebRTC for live audio in rooms
2. Audio transcoding pipeline
3. Social features (following, comments)
4. Push notifications for mobile
5. Audio analytics and recommendations

### 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **MinIO Storage**: Currently using local file storage. For production, set up MinIO or S3.
2. **Live Audio**: WebRTC implementation needs completion for real-time audio in rooms.
3. **Transcoding**: FFmpeg pipeline available but not integrated with upload flow.
4. **Mobile Audio**: Basic implementation - advanced features like background playback need native configuration.

### 💡 Tips

1. **File Uploads**: Currently stored in `server/uploads/` directory
2. **Database**: Sample data includes playlists and rooms for testing
3. **API Testing**: Use the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:3001/docs
4. **Development**: Both web and mobile apps support hot reloading

### 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If services won't start:**
```bash
# Check if ports are in use
lsof -i :3000 -i :3001

# Restart setup if needed
./stop-dev.sh && ./start-dev.sh
```

**If database issues occur:**
```bash
# Re-run migrations
cd server && npm run migrate
```

**For mobile app issues:**
```bash
# Clear Expo cache
cd mobile && npx expo start -c
```
